# Problem Solve Hacker Rank

## List of Problem

### **Problem number one** :

Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from 1 to 100 for three categories: problem clarity, originality, and difficulty.

The rating for Alice's challenge is the triplet a = (a[0], a[1], a[2]), and the rating for Bob's challenge is the triplet b = (b[0], b[1], b[2]).

The task is to find their comparison points by comparing a[0] with b[0], a[1] with b[1], and a[2] with b[2].

If a[i] > b[i], then Alice is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] < b[i], then Bob is awarded 1 point.
If a[i] = b[i], then neither person receives a point.

Comparison points is the total points a person earned.

Given a and b, determine their respective comparison points.

### **Problem number two** :

In this challenge, you are required to calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.

**Function Description**

Complete the aVeryBigSum function in the editor below. It must return the sum of all array elements.

aVeryBigSum has the following parameter(s):

int ar[n]: an array of integers .
Return

long: the sum of all array elements
Input Format

The first line of the input consists of an integer .

The next line contains space-separated integers contained in the array.

**Output Format**

Return the integer sum of the elements in the array.

#

### **Problem number three** :

Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

**Function description**

Complete the function in the editor below.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

int arr[n][m]: an array of integers

**Return**

int: the absolute diagonal difference

#

### **Problem number four** :

Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are positive, negative, and zero. Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line with 6 places after the decimal.

Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to 10^-4 are acceptable.

**Function Description**

Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below.

plusMinus has the following parameter(s):

int arr[n]: an array of integers
Print
Print the ratios of positive, negative and zero values in the array. Each value should be printed on a separate line with 6 digits after the decimal. The function should not return a value.

**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer, n, the size of the array.
The second line contains n space-separated integers that describe arr[n].

**Output Format**

Print the following 3 lines, each to 6 decimals:

1. proportion of positive values
2. proportion of negative values
3. proportion of zeros

#

### **Problem number five** :

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

**Function Description**

Complete the miniMaxSum function in the editor below.

miniMaxSum has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of 5 integers

**Print**

Print two space-separated integers on one line: the minimum sum and the maximum sum of 4 of 5 elements.

**Input Format**

A single line of five space-separated integers.

**Output Format**

Print two space-separated long integers denoting the respective minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. (The output can be greater than a 32 bit integer.)

#

### **Problem number six** :

You are in charge of the cake for a child's birthday. You have decided the cake will have one candle for each year of their total age. They will only be able to blow out the tallest of the candles. Count how many candles are tallest.

**Function Description**

Complete the function birthdayCakeCandles in the editor below.

birthdayCakeCandles has the following parameter(s):

int candles[n]: the candle heights

**Returns**

int: the number of candles that are tallest
